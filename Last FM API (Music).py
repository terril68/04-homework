# # Last FM API (Music)
# 
# Spotify's API is dead to us, so we're using Last.fm's - it's still music, just not as nice of an API.
# 
# 1. Create an account at https://www.last.fm/api/
# 2. Create an "application" to get a key: https://www.last.fm/api/account/create
#     - It isn't a real application, it's just your project
#     - Name/description doesn't matter, ignore callback key and callback url
# 3. And save the API key that shows up on the next screen
# 
# You can find documentation at https://www.last.fm/api/
# 
# The domain for the API is `http://ws.audioscrobbler.com`, so all of your endpoints will be connected to that. To test your API key, check the following URL in your browser: `http://ws.audioscrobbler.com/2.0/?method=artist.search&artist=cher&api_key=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX&format=json` (change the `XXXXXX` to be your API key, of course!).
# 
# > Last.fm used to be called **AudioScrobbler**, which is why its URLs don't have "last.fm" in them.
# > While we're asking about URLs, notice that the API endpoints have a lot of `?` and `&` in them - these are key/value pairs, kind of like dictionaries, but for URLs instead of Python.

# # FIRST: SETUP

# ## 1) Import the libraries/packages you might need
# 
# We need a library to read in the data for us! We don't like `urllib2`, so it must be something cooler and better.

# In[1]:


# Import what you need here
import requests


# ## 2) Save your API key
# 
# Write your API key here so you don't forget it - it's the "api key" one, not the "shared secret" one
# 
# 804cd49166542ef440629a2055b5359f

# ## 3) The death of an API
# 
# I used to have some code here that allowed you to display images, but _the images don't work any more._ Let this be an important lesson: when you depend on external services, they can die at any time.

# In[2]:


#okay


# # NOW: YOUR ASSIGNMENT

# ## 1) Search for and print a list of 50 musicians with `lil` in their name, along with the number of listeners they have
# 
# There are a lot of musicians with "Lil" in their name - it used to be all Lil Wayne and Lil Kim, but we live in a new world now!
# 
# - *Tip: Remember, the domain for the API is `http://ws.audioscrobbler.com`*
# - *Tip: Make sure you ask the API for 50 musicians! This involves adding another parameter to the URL - notice they all have a `&` before them. [Read the documentation](http://www.last.fm/api/show/artist.search) to find the parameter's name.* 
# - *Tip: When you are looking at any piece of data - is it a dictionary? Look at the keys! Is it a list? Look at the first element!*
# - *Tip: LOOK AT THE KEYS. and then the other keys and the other keys and the other keys. It's an ugly series of dictionaries!*

# ```

# Lily Allen has 2074266 listeners
# Lil B has 194116 listeners
# Lilly Wood & The Prick has 359886 listeners
# Lil Ugly Mane has 31955 listeners
# LIL UZI VERT has 88517 listeners
# ```

# ## 2) How many listeners does your list have in total?
# 
# The answer should be roughly **15,000,000**. If it's lower, make sure you have 50 artists instead of 30 artists.
# 
# - *Tip: What's the data type of the `listeners` count? It's going to cause a problem!*
# - *Tip: If you were crazy you could use sum and a list comprehension. But you really don't have to!*

# In[ ]:





# ## 3) Show each artist's name and the URL to the extra-large image
# 
# The images don't work any more, but we'll print their URLs out anyway.

# Each artist **has a list of images of different sizes**. We're interested in the second-to-last one, where `size` is `extralarge`. Print their name and use `display_image` to display their extra-large image.
# 
# - *Tip: The URL should look like this: `https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/300x300/0fc7d7a1812dc79e9925d80382cde594.png`*
# - *Tip: You can always assume it's the second to the last, or assume it's `extralarge`, or whatever you want to do to find it.*
# - *Tip: Make sure the URL is correct before you try to display it.*
# 
# Your output should look something like
# 
# ```
# Lil' Wayne

# ## 4) Find Lil Jon's `mbid` (or anyone else's!).
# 
# Oftentimes in an API, you can do a few things: you can **search** for items, and you can **see more information** about items. To find more information about the item, you need to use their **unique id**. In this dataset, it's called an `mbid` (MusicBrainz, I think - another company associated with last.fm!).
# 
# Go through the artists and print their **name and mbid**. Find Lil Jon's `mbid`. I *wanted* Lil Uzi Vert's, but for some reason it isn't there. Then I wanted us to look at Lily Allen's, but I just couldn't bring myself to do that. If you'd rather do someone else, go for it.

    print("-----------------------------")
    if singer['name']=="Lil Jon":
        print ("the mbid of", singer['name'], "is", singer['mbid'])


# ## 5) Find the artist's name and bio using their `mbid`.
# 
# It can either be Lil Jon or whoever you selected above.
# 
# If you look at the [last.fm documentation](http://www.last.fm/api/show/artist.getInfo), you can see how to use the artist's `mbid` to find more information about them. Print **every tag associated with your artist**.
# 
# - *Tip: It's a new request to the API*
# - *Tip: Use the `mbid`, and make sure you delete the `&name=Cher` from the sample endpoint*
# - *Tip: If you use `print` for the bio it looks a little nicer than it would otherwise*

# ## 6) Print every tag of that artist

# In[19]:


print (liljon_data['artist']['tags'])


# # GETTING A LITTLE CRAZY
# 
# So you know your original list of musicians? I want to get tag data for ALL OF THEM. How are we going to do that?
# 
# ## 7) Find the mbids (again)
# 
# If we have a musician with an mbid of `AAA-AAA-AAA`, we get their info from a url like `http://ws.audioscrobbler.com/blahblah/?api_key=12345&mbid=AAA-AAA-AAA`.
# 
# |artist|url|
# |---|---|
# |`AAA-AAA-AAA`|`http://ws.audioscrobbler.com/blahblah/?api_key=12345&mbid=AAA-AAA-AAA`|
# |`BBB-BBB-BBB`|`http://ws.audioscrobbler.com/blahblah/?api_key=12345&mbid=BBB-BBB-BBB`|
# |`CCC-CCC-CCC`|`http://ws.audioscrobbler.com/blahblah/?api_key=12345&mbid=CCC-CCC-CCC`|
# 
# I guess we should start trying to get a list of all of the mbids.
# 
# **Loop through your artists, and print out the `mbid` for each artist**
# 
# - *Tip: You probably need to request your artist search result data again, because you probably saved over `data` with your other API request. Maybe call it `artist_data` this time?*
# - *Tip: If the artist does NOT have an `mbid`, don't print it.*

# ## 9) Printing our API urls
# 
# To get tag data for each artist, you need to use those `mbid` values to access their artist page on the API. Loop through the mbids, displying the URL you'll need to access.
# 
# - *Tip: You don't want to use a comma when printing, because commas add spaces into your text and URLs can't have that*
# - *Tip: Make sure your URL has `artist.getinfo` in it - if not, you're using the wrong endpoint.*

# In[82]:


#2.0/?method=artist.getinfo&artist=Cher&
url = "http://ws.audioscrobbler.com/2.0/?method=artist.getinfo&api_key=804cd49166542ef440629a2055b5359f&format=json&mbid="

# ## OKAY HERE IS A LITTLE INFORMATION: Using our API urls
# 
# This time instead of just *displaying* the URL, we're going to *request and process it*. **But first I'm going to teach you something.**
# 
# When you're dealing with an API, you don't want to make a million requests, have bad code, and then need to do those million requests again. It's usually best to test your code with a few of the results first.
# 
# So, if we have a list of numbers like this:

# In[27]:


numbers = [4, 5, 6, 7]
numbers


# You can actually say to Python, **give me the first two**, and it will only give you the first two.

# In[28]:


numbers[:2]


# The is **very convenient** with loopng with APIs, because instead of trying to use all FIFTY artists, you can just say "hey, please try this out with 2 of them" and you don't waste time.

# ## 10) Using the first three `mbids`, request the API urls and print the artist's name.
# 
# You built the URLs in the last question, now it's time to use them! Use `requests` etc to grab the URL and get out the artist's name.
# 
# - *Tip: The code is the same as last time you got an artist's name from their info page, it's just going to be inside of a loop*
# - *Tip: USE `PRINT` TO SEE WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING AT!!!!!*

# In[99]:


for url_mbid in result[:3]:
    response= requests.get(url_mbid)
    three_artist_data = response.json()
    print(three_artist_data['artist']['name'])
#print (three_artist_data.keys())
#print (three_artist_data['artist'].keys())


# In[ ]:





# In[ ]:





# ## 11) Using the first three `mbids`, request the API urls and print the artist's name and their tags
# 
# - *Tip: The code is the same as last time you got an artist's name from their info page, it's just going to be inside of a loop*
# - *Tip: It's a for loop in a for loop!*

# ## 12) Using the first ten mbids, print the artist's name and whether they're a rapper
# 
# Only print their name ONCE and only print whether they are hip hop or not ONCE.
# 
# - *Tip: Rap tags include hip hop, swag, crunk, rap, dirty south, and probably a bunch of other stuff! You can include as many categories as you'd like.*
# - *Tip: You can use `2 in [1, 2, 3]` to find out if `2` is in the list of `[1, 2, 3]`.*
# - *Tip: Every time you look at a new artist, you can say they are NOT a rapper. And once you find out one of their tags is hip hop or rap, then you can note that they're a rapper. Then once you're done looking at their tags, then you can say HEY this is a rapper, or HEY this is not a rapper.*
